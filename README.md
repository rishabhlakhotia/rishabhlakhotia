I just found out this 'secret' repository and let's see how this can be used.

I'm a DevSecOps enthusiast and I like to automate things. I like defensive security and a lot of covfefe with chats. 

- I'm currently learning for AWS Certified Developer - Associate
- I like to code in Node.js and Python
- I'm building a mailserver for students to host their custom emails for free (Ping me if you'd like to help)
- Reach me at [hello@rishabhlakhotia.com](mailto:hello@rishabhlakhotia.com).

Most of the work I have done are in the private repositories. However, feel free to go through my open repositories and my projects.

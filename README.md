### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I just found out this 'secret' repository and let's see how this can be used.

I'm a DevOps enthusiast and I like to automate things that can be done manually in 10 minutes. Sigh! I'm currently looking for a DevOps Engineer position and if you're looking to hire you can reach out to me at [hello@rishabhlakhotia.com](mailto:hello@rishabhlakhotia.com). Also, my LinkedIn is at [https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishabhlakhotia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishabhlakhotia).

- I'm currently learning for AWS Certified Developer - Associate
- I like to code in Node.js and Python
- I'm building a mailserver for students to host their custom emails for free (Ping me if you'd like to help)

Feel free to go through my repositories and my projects.
